Learning dead languages can be particularly difficult, since, with no one to talk to, words are often learned as individual units (or even tables of forms) instead of in their natural context. This site aims to aid vocabulary acquisition by teaching word-forms in proper context, from a variety of quotes pulled directly from authentic Latin and classical Greek sentences written by real Romans and Greeks.

This site is written in ReactJS.
