            Glottai (γλῶτται, f.pl.), the Ancient Greek word for "tongues" or "languages", seems a fitting name for a
            site dedicated to learning classical Greek and Latin. Learning a dead language can be troublesome since
            there are no native speakers to converse with, reducing vocabulary acquisition to many boring evenings with
            flashcards. Once you've memorized a few hundred flashcards, you see a paragraph of text in the language, and
            suddenly any sense of confidence is gone. Thankfully, there is another way to learn vocabulary that
            cultivates a familiarity with the language while helping you memorize all those pesky words: by learning
            words exclusively in the context of full sentences and clauses, your mind is trained from day one to feel
            the unique structure each language has. When you finally approach a full paragraph, you can see each clause
            and sentence for what it is, and fearlessly push on to enjoy the literature you're reading. As you continue
            learning, previously learned words are frequently brought to the front of your learning deck in order to
            refresh your memory and increase your mastery, and new words are shown in several contexts for each form to
            ensure you grasp the way they fit into the broader context of the language.

            We're still in the process of adding more words and sentences for your use, and we're working on a login
            system so you can record your learning progress. For the time being, feel free to learn with the words
            available, and contact us if you have any suggestions.
